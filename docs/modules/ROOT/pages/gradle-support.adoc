= Gradle support in Play

To enable the Play support in a Gradle project you need to set the option `generatePlay` to true.
This will make sure play-specific code is generated in addition to plain Pekko gRPC code:

[,groovy]
----
pekkoGrpc {
  language = "Java"
  generateClient = true
  generateServer = true
  extraGenerators = [
    'play.grpc.gen.javadsl.PlayJavaClientCodeGenerator',
    'play.grpc.gen.javadsl.PlayJavaServerCodeGenerator'
  ]
}
----

See the https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko-grpc/current/buildtools/gradle.html[Pekko gRPC Gradle support docs] for further details.
